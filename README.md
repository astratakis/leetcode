# Leetcode Problems & Solutions

Let’s be honest, solving every LeetCode problem doesn’t necessarily make you a great software engineer. But it does sharpen your problem-solving skills.

In a world where everyone’s rushing to use AI for everything, it's easy to forget the value of thinking through problems ourselves. So here's my take:

"One LeetCode problem a day keeps the recruiters away."

Just kidding (sort of). Let's solve some problems and keep our minds sharp!
